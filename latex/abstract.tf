A majority of stars are formed in open clusters, and then ejected into the Galactic field population through tidal effects from external masses, as well as internal gravitational interactions.
Therefore, understanding the internal dynamics of open clusters, through N-Body simulations, will inform the growth of the Galactic stellar population. 
A major input into these N-Body simulations is the frequency and mass distribution of binary star systems. 
Current binary detection techniques, such as radial velocity surveys, have drawbacks which limit their usefulness for detailed studies. 
As presented in the literature, different mass ranges may produce different interpretations of the observed binary population. 
A clearer picture of the binary population, covering a wide mass range, is needed to improve cluster simulations. 
We introduce a new binary detection method, Binary INformation from Open Clusters Using SEDs (BINOCS). 
Using newly-observed multi-wavelength photometric catalogs ($0.3 - 8$ micron) of the key open clusters M35, M36, M37, M67 and NGC 2420, the BINOCS method is able to determine accurate component masses for unresolved cluster binaries. 
We present results on the dynamical evolution of binaries from $0.4 - 2.5$ M$_\odot$ within these key clusters, and explore how these results change with mass.
