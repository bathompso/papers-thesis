\chapter{Science Questions} \label{sec:questions}
This work will attempt to answer three fundamental questions about binary populations in open clusters:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{How is the primordial binary population affected by cluster parameters?}

Star clusters form when some outside force (other cluster passing through the disk, supernova, etc.) shocks a large cloud of gas. Small perturbations in density within the cloud form into single and binary cluster stars. How the distribution of pre-binary density perturbations change with metallicity and overall cluster mass has not been well studied.

Getting detailed information about the binary population of several young clusters may yield insight into how binaries are formed, and if their parameters change in response to environmental variables.

\item \emph{How do binaries affect the dynamical evolution of a cluster?}

Open clusters are slowly destroyed over time, with external effects being described in \S\ref{sec:introClusters}. In addition to the external tidal effects, stars can be ejected from the cluster due to gravitational interaction with other member stars. When a less-massive star gravitationally interacts with a more massive one, it may pick up enough energy to be accelerated beyond the escape velocity of the cluster. Binary systems may amplify this process by contributing part of their orbital energy to interactions, which is usually greater than the kinetic energy of the system moving through the cluster.

Due to the vast timescale over which clusters evolve, stellar ejection cannot be studied observationally. Cluster ejection is usually studied via detailed N-Body simulations \citep{2001MNRAS.323..630H, 2005MNRAS.363..293H}, which can give a detailed description of what stars were ejected, when they were ejected, and how fast they were moving at the time of ejection. Each of these parameters dictate how the field population of the galaxy may have been built up by open cluster dissolution.

N-Body body simulations have already been run to analyze the binary population's effect on escaping stars, discovering only a slight difference when varying the cluster binary percentage from 0 to 70\% \citep{2013MNRAS.434.2509M}. These studies have made assumptions about the binary population, however, such as assuming an even mass-ratio (ratio of larger to smaller star mass) distribution, which may not be the case in reality.

Measuring the cluster binary fraction and mass-ratio distribution (as a function of primary mass) for real clusters will go a long way in calibrating these N-Body simulations. Analyzing open clusters with various ages will also allow N-Body simulations to check intermediate steps against these ``benchmarks,'' further improving their accuracy and predicting power.

\item \emph{How does the cluster environment affect the dynamical evolution of its binary population?}

A primordial open cluster contains a uniform distribution of stellar masses, when scaled by density. Although the core is more dense than the outer regions of the cluster, there is no physical mechanism that would cause a different distribution of density perturbations in each region. This means that, when the cluster is newly formed, there are the same \emph{percentage} of 4 M$_\odot$ stars in a given area of the cluster as there are 1 M$_\odot$ stars.

More massive stars preferentially transfer energy to smaller stars via gravitational interactions such that, over time, the cluster approaches an equipartition of energy. When kinetic energy is a constant, the maximum velocity of a star during its path through the cluster, and hence the furthest distance it can travel, scales inversely with mass. This means that, over time, more massive stars become more centrally concentrated than less massive ones. This phenomenon is called \emph{mass segregation}, and is seen observationally in many open clusters.

Because binary systems are more massive than a comparable single star, they too experience mass segregation. Initially, the binary fraction is constant with radius, just as with single stars. Over time, binaries become more centrally concentrated, leading to higher binary fractions near the core of the cluster and lower binary fractions towards the halo. This has also been seen observationally in many old open clusters \citep{1986AJ.....92.1364M, 2012AJ....144...54G}.

Most recently, there were two binary studies of the young, dense cluster NGC 1818, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The first study, published in \citet{1998MNRAS.300..857E}, confirmed what had been seen many times before: a decreasing binary percentage with radius, indicative of mass segregation. Even with the relative youth of NGC 1818 (30 Myr), \citeauthor{1998MNRAS.300..857E} found binary systems have undergone enough dynamical evolution to become segregated. A follow-up study in \citet{2013ApJ...765....4D} found a completely different, and somewhat remarkable, result: not only were binary systems not mass segregated, but binary fraction actually \emph{increased} with radius.

Using open clusters with a variety of ages, from 30 Myr to 3.5 Gyr, the radial migration of the binary population can be tracked through time. Using these data, the conflicting NGC 1818 studies can be understood and reconciled.
