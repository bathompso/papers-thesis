I would never have been able to finish (or start) my dissertation without guidance from many others; first and foremost my wife, who celebrated my research gains every day, even though most of the time she had no idea what I was rambling about. \\

\noindent I would like to thank Dr. Peter Frinchaboy for coming up with the idea for this project, setting me along the path, and constantly supporting me throughout my graduate school journey. I also thank him for constantly interrupting that journey with his many side projects, without which I would not have been able to pursue my future career. \\

\noindent I would like to thank Dr. Ata Sarajedini, Dr. Aaron Geller, and the other members of the WOCS consortium who did much of the heavy lifting for this work on outside projects, and quickly transferred that data and knowledge to me. \\

\noindent Lastly, I would like to thank my friends, inside and outside the lab, who made it an enjoyable five years in Texas.
