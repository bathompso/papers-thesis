\section{Isochrone Systems} \label{sec:isochrones}

An isochrone is a set of model stars, varying in mass, with the same age and metallicity; a synthetic cluster. When plotted on a CMD, an isochrone should trace out the location of every single star in the cluster. As described in \S\ref{sec:binocs}, these single models are then combined to form the full binary library that are compared against observation. The \textsc{binocs} results are only as good as the underlying models themselves, and despite years of refinement, stellar structure models have not yet been perfected. Competing isochrone systems, which adopt different physical inputs than one another, show significant differences along the main sequence, which is perhaps the most well-understood phase of stellar evolution. We test several competing stellar structure models against our observed data to determine which system is most realistic.

\subsection{Isochrone Physics} \label{sec:isochrone_physics}

Stellar structure models compute stellar parameters through two phases of modeling. First, a \emph{stellar core} is computed by building the star layer-by-layer. Using the mass and age of the star, stellar core models return two values: the star's temperature and surface gravity. These two values uniquely determine a star's position on the H-R diagram, with surface gravity becoming an analogue to luminosity. Using Newtonian gravity ($g = GM/R^2$), the radius of the star can also be inferred. On first approximation, the energy output of a star is a near-blackbody, governed by the temperature derived for the core model. In reality, the spectrum also has absorption lines from elements in the star's atmosphere. A \emph{stellar atmosphere} is generated using the temperature and surface gravity from the core model, as well as individual elemental abundances. Atomic and molecular absorption lines are overlaid on the blackbody spectrum and the synthetic flux is output.

Competing isochrone systems incorporate different physical assumptions, such as the equation of state (EOS) model, or the conductive and radiative opacity values, which govern energy transport within the stellar core. Some models use a very basic ideal-gas EOS, while others use a complex, computationally-intensive EOS that accounts for ionization, degeneracy pressure, and relativistic electron gas. Different models also differ on physical processes, specifying different mixing lengths for convection, and using alternate atmosphere models. Even basic physical parameters, such as the fraction of Helium within stars, the heavy-element mixture of the Sun, or solar metallicity, are not constant between systems.

In this work, we consider four well-known isochrone systems: Dartmouth \citep{Dotter:2007fh}, Y$^2$ \citep{2001ApJS..136..417Y}, Padova \citep{2002AA...391..195G}, and PARSEC \citep{2012MNRAS.427..127B}. Values for many aspects of the input physics within these models are shown in table \ref{tab:isoparams}.

\subsection{Comparison to CMDs} \label{sec:isocompare_cmd}

Isochrones are often fit to CMDs in order to assess the quality of fit. The four isochrone systems studied in this work are compared to three CMDs of the cluster M37 in figure \ref{fig:isocompare_cmd}.

\begin{figure} \centering
\includegraphics[trim= 0mm 102mm 0mm 0mm, clip, width=0.95\textwidth]{../plots/eps/isocompare_cmd.eps}
\caption{Comparison of isochrone systems to various CMDs of M37. \emph{Red:} PARSEC; \emph{Orange:} Padova; \emph{Blue:} Dartmouth. All isochrones are 350 Myr, with [Fe/H]$=+0.08$, E($B-V$)$= 0.30$, at a distance of 1386 pc. \label{fig:isocompare_cmd}}
\end{figure}

It is apparent from figure \ref{fig:isocompare_cmd} that all isochrone systems fit well (and similarly) above $g \sim 19$, and diverge lower on the main sequence, to varying degrees. The \textsc{binocs} routine builds synthetic binary stars using every possible combination of single stars within an isochrone model; deviations between observation and theory for low-mass stars will throw off fits to binary systems across the entire mass range. The isochrone models must been improved before they can be used to predict accurate masses of cluster stars.

An isochrone fit to several CMDs of one cluster, as seen in figure \ref{fig:isocompare_cmd}, can show that the isochrone systems diverge from observation at low mass, but does not provide information on \emph{why} this occurs. Ideally, one would like to determine which of the physical inputs described in \S\ref{sec:isochrone_physics} improve an isochrone fit, and which ones detract. To do this, isochrones must be compared to a range of clusters with different ages and metallicities. Using the clusters in our dataset for which we have complete photometric data, this procedure can be accomplished.


\subsection{Isochrone Preparation}

There are a large number of variables that differ between isochrone systems, even beyond those listed in table \ref{tab:isoparams}. If a comparison of models is to produce any useful insights, some of these variables must be removed from consideration. This can be done by standardizing some aspects of the isochrones.

\subsubsection{Metallicity}

The metallicity of an isochrone has a large affect on its shape. To compare isochrones of various systems to one another, each must have a common [Fe/H]. Y$^2$ isochrones can be interpolated to any required [Fe/H] by an included FORTRAN routine. Padova and PARSEC isochrones are available for any metallicity from their online source, the interactive CMD 2.5 interface\footnote{http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd}.  Dartmouth isochrones are also available with any metallicity from an online source\footnote{http://stellar.dartmouth.edu/\%7Emodels/webtools.html}, but are only available for cluster ages $> 1$ Gyr. A ``base grid'' of Dartmouth isochrones are available, for any age, with [Fe/H]$= -1.0, -0.5, +0.07, +0.21, +0.36, +0.56$.

For each cluster, isochrones are generated with the metallicity denoted in table \ref{tab:clusterParameters}. For young clusters ($<1$ Gyr), Dartmouth models will only be used if the cluster [Fe/H] is within 0.01 of a ``base grid'' metallicity.

\subsubsection{Age}

Not all isochrone systems have a common age grid. Padova and PARSEC isochrones exist for constant steps of 0.05 in $\log(Age)$, from 6.6 (4 Myr) to 10.1 (12.6 Gyr). Y$^2$ and Dartmouth isochrones, instead, exist in steps in linear Age. Y$^2$ spans the ages of 100 Myr to 13.5 Gyr, while Dartmouth covers the 250 Myr to 15 Gyr range. Due to the difference in age ranges between systems, and the $\log(Age)$ vs linear Age steps, not all isochrone systems will have the exact age of a specific cluster.

For most clusters, the closest age may vary up to as much as 100 Myr between systems. As we are most interested in how isochrones model the main sequence, where \textsc{binocs} is most effective, this age difference will not cause any problems. Main sequence lifetimes are often in the Gyr timescale, with little change in properties; the 100 Myr difference between isochrone systems will not affect the results for main sequence stars.

\subsubsection{Atmospheres}

As seen in table \ref{tab:isoparams}, all isochrone systems use different atmosphere models, which poses a problem for understanding what physical processes improve isochrone fits. Stars with similar internal parameters (surface gravity, temperature), but different atmosphere models, may look high discrepant on a CMD. Any differences between isochrone systems in the stellar core phase may be overshadowed by differences in the atmosphere color-temperature relations.

To avoid this confusion, atmosphere models will be standardized across all isochrone systems, allowing for direct comparison of internal structure physics to observed data. As we also wish to test the accuracy of the atmosphere models themselves, two alternate models will be applied to each isochrone: ATLAS9 \citep{2003IAUS..210P.A20C}, and BT-Settl \citep{2012RSPTA.370.2765A}.

ATLAS9\footnote{http://wwwuser.oat.ts.astro.it/castelli/colors.html} and BT-Settl\footnote{http://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/BT-Settl/} color-temperature relations were available from pre-computed grids online. The first few lines of the BT-Settl grid is shown in table \ref{tab:btsettl}. The star's intrinsic parameters are taken as an input into the grid: [Fe/H], surface gravity ($\log g$), temperature, and \emph{bolometric magnitude} --- the magnitude determined from the full luminosity of the star. Using the full grid, the output columns are interpolated to the exact parameters of the star.

\begin{table} \centering
\begin{tabular}{|ccc|ccccc|} \hline
[Fe/H] & $\log g$ & $T$ & BC$_V$ & $U-V$ & $B-V$ & $V-R$ & $V-I$ \\ \hline \hline
 +0.00 &  4.00 & 2000 & -6.8210 & 7.9860 & 3.2970 & 4.1080 & 7.4740  \\

 -4.00 &  4.00 & 2000 & -6.8210 & 8.7580 & 2.6850 & 2.1920 & 3.4510  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\caption{Sample of the first few lines and columns of the BT-Settl pre-computed color-temperature grid. \label{tab:btsettl}}}
\end{table}

Output from the grid is the \emph{bolometric correction} to $V$, BC$_V$. This is the difference between the star's bolometric magnitude and its magnitude in the $V$ filter: $V = M_{bol} - BC_V$. Also output are the colors of the star, all using the $V$ filter (as seen in table \ref{tab:btsettl}). Using only the four input values, all magnitudes can be determined for the star. While table \ref{tab:btsettl} only shown color terms for the Johnson-Cousins filter system, more filters are available in the atmosphere grids. BT-Settl grids contain color terms for all 17 filters used in the \textsc{binocs} routine: $UBVRIugrizJHK_S$[3.6][4.5][5.8][8.0]. ATLAS9 grids contain all filters but the IRAC mid-IR bands.

In the following analysis, observed data will be compared to 11 different isochrones. The original Padova, PARSEC, and Dartmouth isochrones will be compared to the observational data. The atmosphere model included with the Y$^2$ isochrones does not contain SDSS $ugriz$ magnitudes, and will therefore not be compared to clusters with $ugriz$ optical photometry. Similarly, the online ATLAS9 color transformation does not include mid-IR magnitudes, so no systems will be compared in those bands when using grid-derived ATLAS9 atmospheres.

\subsection{Empirical Ridgelines}

Comparison of observed photometry to 11 different isochrones in up to 9 colors, for several clusters, will become unwieldy if CMDs are to be used. To simplify plotting and allow deeper understanding of the isochrone deviations, \emph{empirical ridgelines} are used. Empirical ridgelines are hand-drawn traces of the observed single-star main sequence, as seen in figure \ref{fig:ridge_cmd}. Instead of showing isochrones overplotted on a CMD to asses their fit, residuals between isochrone-predicted colors and empirical ridgeline colors can be shown to illustrate the same concept. Small residuals in predicted vs observed colors will mean a good fit.

\begin{figure} \centering
\includegraphics[trim= 0mm 102mm 0mm 0mm, clip, width=0.95\textwidth]{../plots/eps/ridge_cmd.eps}
\caption{Empirical ridgelines for several CMDs of M37. \label{fig:ridge_cmd}}
\end{figure}

Empirical ridgelines have been determined for several clusters: M35, M36, M37, M67 and NGC 2420. These ridgelines were created by visual inspection of various cluster CMDs, and tracing the main sequence. Values for these ridgelines, as well as a comparison to the observed CMDs, are located in appendix \ref{app:ridgelines}.

\subsection{Comparison}
Clusters for which ridgelines exist were compared to isochrone systems. Residuals were computed for all 9 available CMDs, and are shown for each cluster in subsections below.


\subsubsection{M36}\label{sec:m36iso}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[trim= 0mm 40mm 0mm 0mm, clip, width=0.99\textwidth]{../plots/eps/ridgeline_m36.eps}
\caption{Comparison of isochrone systems to empirical ridgeline for M36 in 9 CMDs. Padova and PARSEC isochrones are 30 Myr, Y$^2$ isochrones are 100 Myr. All isochrones are [Fe/H] = +0.00, E($B-V$) = 0.22, at a distance of 1324 pc. \emph{Red:} PARSEC; \emph{Orange:} Padova. \label{fig:m36_resid}}
\end{figure}

Isochrone ridgeline residuals are shown in figure \ref{fig:m36_resid}. M36 does not have a published metallicity \citep{2002AA...389..871D}, so it was compared against solar-metallicity isochrones. Due to the young age of M36 (30 Myr), not all isochrone systems will have a similar age. Padova and PARSEC cover the young age range, and 30 Myr isochrones were used in the comparison. Y$^2$'s youngest age is 100 Myr; the highly discrepant residuals above $V \sim 11.5$ are due to Y$^2$ isochrones containing a turn-off which does not exist in the observed cluster. After interpolating Dartmouth isochrones, the youngest available age is 1 Gyr, too much older than the observed cluster to produce any useful insight. Dartmouth isochrones are therefore not shown in figure \ref{fig:m36_resid}.


\subsubsection{M35}
