annote = {Intermediate age clusters: show lots of stars with convective-core overshoot:
	Mixing of chemicals from the core to the inner layers.  Study more.
Convective core overshoot leads to strange photometric phenomena, which would cause many of the cluster stars to be rejects by photometric studies.  RV + proper motion studies needed.
Convective core overshoot leads to the "Blue Hook" -- stars at the end of the main sequence become bluer before going through the turnoff point and over to the giant branch.
	Gap between main sequence and giant branch (caused by blue hook) could be filled by binaries which cant be detected by the study (can we detect them?)

NGC 6819 has had a few studies, but they didn't have a comprehensive study for the upper main sequence + giant branch.  This study looked specifically at that region.

NGC 6819 is roughly 2.4-2.5GYr.  In Kepler field.

A 1 degree field of view, with magnitude range 11 }

{\#}{\#}{\#}{\#}
Young clusters provide direct study of near-primordial characteristics of stellar population, giving us the super-important initial conditions for computer simulations.  As a part of WOCS, there were 5201 radial-velocity measurements taken of 1144 stars in M35, with V magnitudes between 13.0 and 16.5, over the course of 13 years.  Images, for the V and B bands, were taken using the Peak Burrell Schmitt telescope at Kitt Peak.  The cluster was observed 3 times per year, focusing on stars of interest, giving an error in RV measurements between 0.5 and 1.0 km/s.  By fitting a Gaussian to the cross-correlation function (***), the RV of the star can be determined.  

After 3 measurements on the same star, if the standard deviation in RV measurements are greater than 2.0 km/s (sufficiently above the error in the measurements), then the star is treated as suspect and is studied further.  Those stars with deviations less than 2, the stars are classified as single stars and are ignored for future observations.  60% of the stars detected in M35 had 3 or more observations, enough for a determination whether the star is a binary or not.

In total, 360 cluster members were identified.  The cluster was fit to a 180 Myr Padova Isochrone, which allowed the identification of 33 possible variables.  11 of those possible variables showed RV variability, and were possible binaries.  The method used in the study detects binaries with a period at or less than 10^4 days.

Mass segregation was only seen in stars with masses greater than 2 solar masses, and the binaries within the magnitude range of the study have combined masses less than that.  Therefore, no mass segregation is seen in the binaries of M35.

NGC 188 is an old cluster, and thus represents the ending conditions for computer simulations.  The WOCS RV study started in 1996, and has gathered 11 years of observations on the cluster.  Combining with previous spectroscopic data, some of the stars in the cluster have 35 years worth of observations.  The study looked at stars in the 12 < V < 16.5 and B-V > 0.4 regions, which was comprised of 1498 stars.  Combining the results with previous proper motion studies, 473 cluster members were identified.  NGC 188 is out of the plane of the galaxy, so cluster membership was not contaminated by many field stars, as was the case with NGC 6819.
	The most notable results from the study were concerning the properties of blue stragglers (BS) in the cluster.  21 BS were identified, and 16 (75%) were determined to be velocity variables, which is to be expected since they are believed to have been formed in a binary system.  BS should be the most massive stars in the cluster, since they are thought to have formed through mergers or mass transfer from other stars, and therefore should exhibit mass segregation.  In NGC 188, however, BS do not exhibit any mass segregation.  M67 is roughly the same age as NGC 188, and it shows definitive mass segregation for BS there, so it may be possible there are different formation processes at work.  The researchers posited that there were two different groups of BS in NGC 188.  One BS group formed close to the cluster core and settled towards the center from dynamical friction + relaxation effects, exactly what would be expected.  Another group, through interactions with other stars, were ejected to the outer regions of the cluster, where the relaxation time is much longer, so they have not had time to settle to the inner regions.
