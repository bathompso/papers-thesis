& \\
CMD 		& \emph{Color-Magnitude Diagram}. Observational form of H-R Diagram, usually used for star clusters. \\
H-R Diagram	& Plot of stellar temperature against luminosity. Separates stars into defined evolutionary phases. \\
2MASS		& \emph{Two-micron All Sky Survey}. Near-IR ($JHK_S$ filter, 1-3 $\mu$m) all-sky photometric survey. \\
WISE		& \emph{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}. Mid-IR ([3.4][4.6], 3-5 $\mu$m) all-sky photometric survey space telescope. \\
IR 			& \emph{Infrared}. This work is concerned with IR wavelengths from 1-8 $\mu$m. \\
CCD			& \emph{Charge-Coupled Device}. Detector type used for most optical-wavelength observations. \\
NGC			& \emph{New General Catalogue}. Catalog of 7,840 deep-sky objects, including most of the open clusters considered in this work. \\
RV			& \emph{Radial Velocity}. Line-of-sight doppler shift. \\
SED			& \emph{Spectral Energy Distribution}. Integrated flux profile of a star across considered filters. As a first approximation, a blackbody curve. \\
