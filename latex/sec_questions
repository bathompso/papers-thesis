\section{Science Questions} \label{sec:questions}
In this work, we will answer three fundamental questions about binary populations in open clusters:

\begin{enumerate}
{\large \item \emph{How is the primordial binary population affected by cluster parameters?}}

Star clusters form when some outside force (other cluster passing through the disk, supernova, etc.) shocks a large cloud of gas. Small perturbations in density within the cloud form into single and binary cluster stars. How the distribution of pre-binary density perturbations change with metallicity and overall cluster mass has not been well studied.

Getting detailed information about the binary population of several very young clusters may yield insight into how binaries are formed, and if their parameters change in response to environmental variables.

{\large \item \emph{How do binaries affect the dynamical evolution of a cluster?}}

Open clusters are slowly destroyed over time, with external effects being described in \S\ref{sec:introClusters}. In addition to the external tidal effects, stars can be ejected from the cluster due to gravitational interaction with other member stars. When a less-massive star gravitationally interacts with a more massive one, it may pick up enough energy to be accelerated beyond the escape velocity of the cluster. Binary systems may amplify this process by contributing part of their orbital energy to interactions, which is usually greater than the kinetic energy of the system through the cluster.

Due to the vast timescale over which clusters evolve, stellar ejection cannot be studied observationally. Cluster ejection is usually studied via detailed N-Body simulations \citep{2001MNRAS.323..630H, 2005MNRAS.363..293H}, which can give a detailed description of what stars were ejected, when they were ejected, and how fast they were moving at the time of ejection. Each of these parameters dictate how the field population of the galaxy may have been built up by open cluster dissolution.

N-Body body simulations have already been run to analyze the binary population's effect on escaping stars, discovering only a slight difference when varying the cluster binary percentage from 0 to 70\% \citep{2013MNRAS.434.2509M}. These studies have made assumptions about the binary population, however, such as assuming an even mass-ratio (ratio of secondary mass to primary mass) distribution, which may not be the case in reality.

Measuring the cluster binary fraction and mass-ratio distribution (as a function of primary mass) for real clusters will go a long way in calibrating these N-Body simulations. Analyzing open clusters with various ages will also allow N-Body simulations to check intermediate steps against these ``benchmarks,'' further improving their accuracy and predicting power.

{\large \item \emph{How does the cluster environment affect the dynamical evolution of its binary population?}}

A primordial open cluster contains a uniform distribution of stellar masses, when scaled by density. Although the core is more dense than the outer regions of the cluster, there is no physical mechanism that would cause a different distribution of density perturbations in each region. This means that, when the cluster is newly formed, there are the same \emph{percentage} of 4 M$_\odot$ stars in a given area of the cluster as there are 1 M$_\odot$ stars.

More massive stars preferentially transfer energy to smaller stars via gravitational interactions such that, over time, the cluster approaches an equipartition of energy. When kinetic energy is a constant, the maximum velocity of a star during its path through the cluster, and hence the furthest distance it can travel, scales inversely with mass. This means that, over time, more massive stars become more centrally concentrated than less massive stars. This phenomenon is called \emph{mass segregation}, and is seen observationally in many open clusters.

Because binary systems are more massive than a comparable single star, they too experience mass segregation. Initially, the binary fraction is constant with radius, just as with single stars. Over time, binaries become more centrally concentrated, leading to higher binary fractions near the core of the cluster and lower binary fractions towards the halo. This has also been seen observationally in many old open clusters \citep{1986AJ.....92.1364M, 2012AJ....144...54G}.

Most recently, there were two binary studies of the young, dense cluster NGC 1818, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The first studied, published in \citet{1998MNRAS.300..857E}, confirmed what had been seen many times before: a decreasing binary percentage with radius, indicative of mass segregation. Even with the relative youth of NGC 1818 (30 Myr), \citeauthor{1998MNRAS.300..857E} found binary systems have undergone enough dynamical evolution to become segregated. A follow-up study in \citet{2013ApJ...765....4D} found a completely different, and somewhat remarkable, result: not only were binary systems not mass segregated, but binary fraction actually \emph{increased} with radius.

Using open clusters with a variety of ages, from 30 Myr to 3.5 Gyr, the radial migration of the binary population can be tracked through time. Using these data, the conflicting NGC 1818 studies can be understood and reconciled. Radial distributions can also be correlated with density and metallicity to check if environment has an effect on mass segregation of binary systems.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Current Binary Detection Techniques} \label{sec:currentTechniques}
Current cluster binary studies are carried out using one of two methods, each of which experience issues which limit their effectiveness in answering the above science questions. The strengths and limitations of the two current methods are described below.

\subsubsection{Two-Band Photometry} \label{sec:twoBand}
Binary stars will be brighter than a single star with the same mass as the primary, due to additional flux from the secondary star. In addition, the star's color will be shifted by the smaller (and hence redder) star. When plotted on a CMD, main sequence binary stars will be offset above and to the right from the single star main sequence. Considering the special case of an equal-mass binary system, the binary system will have the same color as a component single star, but will be twice as bright. Using equation \eqref{eq:MagSystem}, we find the difference in magnitudes:

\begin{equation}
m_S - m_B = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F_S}{F_B} \right) = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F_S}{2 F_S} \right) = 0.753
\end{equation}

An equal-mass binary system will be located 0.753 magnitudes above the corresponding single star on a CMD. Binaries with a mass ratio less than one will be located at various locations between the single star main sequence and the equal mass binary sequence on the CMD. Two-band photometry studies attempt to measure the binary properties of a cluster using a single CMD by measuring the distance between a star and the single star main sequence.

The distance a binary star is from the single star main sequence depends not only on the mass ratio of both stars, but also the primary mass. Figure \ref{fig:twoBandCMD} shows the position of binary stars on a CMD for various primary masses and mass ratios. Binaries with a mass ratio of 0.5 (open squares) lie close to the single star main sequence for primary stars with mass $< 2 M_\odot$ and close to the equal mass binary sequence for primary masses of $> 3 M_\odot$.

For each primary mass, points are plotted on the CMD for every binary mass fraction in steps of 0.1. Open squares are binaries with a mass ratio of 0.5. \label{fig:twoBandCMD}}}
\end{figure}
This binary detection technique is very sensitive to errors. For low mass primaries, small color errors will blend together single stars and binaries with a mass ratio of $< 0.5$. On the high mass end, it becomes hard to differentiate between primary masses, as all binaries with mass ratios $> 0.5$ lie along the equal mass binary track. Figure \ref{fig:twoBandCMD} shows binary positions for high primary masses in a grid of 1 $M_\odot$. Attempting to measure using a finer grid is impossible as many binaries will begin to overlap.

Two-band photometry studies are most useful for quickly determining the binary fraction of a cluster; it only requires measurements in two filters. While it is impossible to accurately determine individual masses of binary systems, binaries with mass ratios greater than 0.5 can be grouped together and measured (see \citep{2012AA...540A..16M}). Determining the individual mechanics of the binary systems within a cluster, necessary for the science drivers of this research, requires a more robust approach.


\subsubsection{Radial Velocity Studies}\label{sec:PastRV}
The most accurate way of detecting binaries is through the use of radial velocities of spectroscopic binaries (described in \S\ref{sec:specBinary}). The value of these studies is the wealth of information on star orbits that can be determined (orbital period, eccentricity). RV studies of cluster binaries, while powerful due to the amount of information they give, are limited in several ways.\\

\noindent \textbf{Sample Size:} Since RVs are determined spectroscopically, there are only a small number of stars that can be measured at a single time. Photometry of a cluster can determine magnitudes for thousands of stars with a single image, while spectroscopy, at maximum, can measure spectra for a few hundred stars at once. In order to survey a cluster, a large amount of telescope time must be used to cover all stars.\\

\noindent \textbf{Multiple Visits:} Stellar spectra must be obtained multiple times in order to determine whether a star is a binary or not. Fully characterizing the orbits of both stars requires many repeat observations, depending on the orbital period of the system. This multiplies the necessary telescope time for a quality RV study in order to detect and classify binaries. \\

\noindent \textbf{Limiting Magnitude:} In order to accurately determine a star's velocity, a certain level of signal-to-noise must be achieved. For a high-resolution spectrometer (R $\sim$ 20,000), the incoming flux is spread across all resolution elements. Comparing to a comparable length photometric exposure, we find the limiting magnitude difference:

\begin{equation}
m_{\text{phot}} - m_{\text{spec}} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{1}{20000} \right) = 10.8
\label{eq:SpecLimit}
\end{equation}

In the time it will take a spectroscopic measurement to complete on a 10th magnitude star, all stars down to 20th magnitude could be measured photometrically to the same signal-to-noise. Low-mass stars are more numerous than high-mass stars, and therefore very important when understanding the dynamics of the cluster system. Ignoring a vast majority of the low-mass members within a cluster will severely hamper the power of the results. \\

\noindent \textbf{Inclination \& Orbital Period:} Mass determination using double-lined binaries is complicated by the inclination of the system. While RV studies can determine the orbital mechanics of the system, they cannot accurately determine masses. Without accurate masses for a large percentage of binary systems within the cluster, the science goals cannot be achieved. In addition, RV studies are limited by the resolution of their spectrometer; systems with doppler shifts less than the resolution of the spectrometer will not be registered as variable. Only binary systems with short enough orbital periods will produce large enough doppler shifts to be detected. \\

Both of the current binary detection methods have been shown to be inadequate to answer the science questions posed above. To deeply understand the binary populations of open clusters, and new method must be employed which can determine accurate masses for all members of a cluster within a reasonable amount of telescope time.
